# Ideology and Vision

## Mission

LiqCoin aims to resolve conflicts of interest between builders, investors, and traders in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Our mission is to provide a simple, secure, and efficient platform for coin creation and investment, emphasizing community-driven development and user-friendliness. We enable anyone to launch their  coin with liquidity-funding support, making token creation accessible without requiring coding expertise.

## Why Choose LiqCoin?

* **Built-in Liquidity Pool**: Coins launch with a liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange (DEX), ensuring immediate tradability.
* **Secure Fundraising**: Time-locked liquidity and a transparent funding process enhance safety for investors and credibility for creators.

## How It Works

1. **Create**: Fill in coin details, set fundraising goals, and configure liquidity parameters.
2. **Fund**: Investors contribute ETH to the fundraising pool, with progress tracked in real-time.
3. **Launch**: Once funded, the coin and liquidity pool are automatically created, and liquidity provider (LP) positions are distributed.
